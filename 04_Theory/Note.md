# Fiber 
Note: Network based UI updation

React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team.

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of 
updates; and new concurrency primitives.

We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

- pause work and come back to it later.
- assign priority to different types of work.
- reuse previously completed work.
- abort work if it's no longer needed.
